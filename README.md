### RFID Card Programming
**No separate programmer needed!** The jukebox includes integrated RFID programming:

#### Programming Mode:
1. **Enter programming mode**: Type `p` in Serial Monitor
2. **Choose programming type**:
   - `auto` - Sequential numbering starting from your chosen number
   - `manual` - Enter specific numbers for each card
   - `read` - Read and display existing card numbers
3. **Program your cards**: Place cards on reader as prompted
4. **Return to jukebox**: Type `jukebox` when done

#### Quick Setup for New Cards:
```
1. Type: p                 (enter programming mode)
2. Type: auto              (automatic sequential programming)  
3. Type: 1                 (start numbering from 1)
4. Place card 1 on reader  (writes number 1)
5. Place card 2 on reader  (writes number 2)
6. Continue for all cards...
7. Type: jukebox          (return to music mode)
```

## Configuration

### PlatformIO Settings
The `platformio.ini` file is configured for:
- **Platform**: Espressif32
- **Board**: ESP32 Dev Module
- **Framework**: Arduino
- **Monitor Speed**: 115200 baud
- **Upload Speed**: 921600 baud

### Libraries
- `miguelbalboa/MFRC522@^1.4.10` - RFID operations
- `dfrobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini@^1.0.6` - MP3 player control

### Build Flags
- `CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=3` - Enhanced debugging output

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**DFPlayer not responding:**
- Check wiring connections (especially TX/RX)
- Ensure SD card is properly formatted (FAT32)
- Verify MP3 files are numbered correctly (001.mp3, 002.mp3, etc.)
- Check power supply (DFPlayer needs 5V)

**RFID cards not detected:**
- Verify RC522 connections
- Check antenna gain setting in code
- Ensure cards are properly programmed
- Test with known working cards

**System resets frequently:**
- Check power supply stability
- Monitor Serial output for error messages
- Verify all connections are secure
- Check for interference from other devices

**No audio output:**
- Verify speaker connections
- Check volume settings (use `v`, `+`, `-` commands)
- Test with headphones first
- Ensure MP3 files are valid

### Debug Mode
Enable additional debug output by:
1. Setting `CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=3` in platformio.ini (already set)
2. Monitoring Serial output at 115200 baud
3. Using serial commands to check system status

## Advanced Features

### Custom Playlists
Create themed playlists by organizing MP3 files in folders:
- `01/` - Kids songs
- `02/` - Classical music  
- `03/` - Rock/Pop
- `04/` - Ambient/Relaxation
- etc.

Program RFID cards with negative numbers to trigger these playlists.

### Volume Presets
Modify the code to set different volume levels for different card types or times of day.

### WiFi Integration
The ESP32's WiFi capabilities can be added for:
- Web-based control interface
- Streaming from online sources
- Remote playlist management
